VIDAS is a real-time assistive AI system that converts live visual input into precise navigation and cognitive guidance using computer vision and low-latency AI reasoning.

By integrating YOLO-based object detection with Groq-powered AI inference, VIAS delivers instant, spoken navigation cues, object awareness, and dyslexic assistance in complex urban environments like Bengaluru.
