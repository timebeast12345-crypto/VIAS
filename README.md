# VIDAS
## Description
The B2 Bombers are developing VIDAS: the Visually Impaired and Dyslexic Assistance Simulator. We are building an AI-powered accessibility website that supports visually impaired and dyslexic users through object detection, navigation assistance, dyslexic-friendly reading tools, customizable fonts, background filters, and text-to-speech — making reading and navigation easier for everyone.  

## Unique Selling Point
VIDAS is a real-time assistive AI system that converts live visual input into precise navigation and cognitive guidance using computer vision and low-latency AI reasoning.  

By integrating YOLO-based object detection with Groq-powered AI inference, VIDAS delivers instant, spoken navigation cues, object awareness, and dyslexic assistance in complex urban environments like Bengaluru. Unlike traditional accessibility tools that operate in isolation, VIDAS provides a unified, end-to-end accessibility pipeline designed for real-world chaos, not controlled demos.
